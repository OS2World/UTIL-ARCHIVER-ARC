This is the ARC archiving utility in a version for MS-DOS and OS/2.
The sources were posted to comp.sources.unix some time ago I think.
I made some changes for using the Microsoft C compiler 5.1 instead
of the old Computer Innovations C86 for which the original sources
were written.

The executable files are bound to run on both DOS and OS/2 (protected
mode) operating systems.
